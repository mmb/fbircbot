rbot plugin that monitors a user's Facebook news stream and writes
new items to an IRC channel.

Can be combined with rbot's built-in feed monitoring capability to create a
channel on a private IRC server that is a custom stream of personal news
from Facebook, Twitter, etc.

Facebook API connection currently done through a Facebook app I have
created in sandbox mode (only its developers can use it). My Facebook
user has given this app "read_stream" and "offline_access" permissions. It
requires an infinite session cookie be generated and hardcoded into the
plugin.

Automatic updating is turned off for now but works when run manually.
